# Intro-to-programming-final-project
This is the final project of Udacity "Intro to programming" course (https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000). This project uses python classes and some modules such as webbrowser, os, re to generate static web page with a few videos. Initially this should be a web page with trailers of my favorite movies but I changed this to some cosmic videos. Anyway each class stores title, description, link and image to each video. Web page generates by "entertainment_center.py" file.
